* Developer name: RÃ©gis Schulze
* 3D House Project
* Repository: 3D_houses
* Type of Challenge: Learning & Consolidation
* Duration: 2 weeks
* Deadline: 25/02/21 5:00 PM
* Deployment strategy : Github page | Powerpoint | Spyder
* Team challenge : solo
* 
## Mission objectives
Consolidate the knowledge in Python, specifically in :

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## Learning Objectives
* to be able to search and implement new librairies
* to be able to read and use shapefiles
* to be able to read and use geoTIFFs
* to be able to render a 3D plot
* to be able to present a final product

## The Mission
We are LIDAR PLANES , active in the Geospatial industy. We would like to use our data to launch a new branch in the insurrance business. So, we need you to build a solution with our data to model a house in 3D with only a home address in the area of Flanders.


#### What is LIDAR ?
LIDAR is a method to measure distance using light. The device will illuminate a target with a laser light and a sensor will measure the reflection. Differences in wavelength and return times will be used to get 3D representations of an area.


The data used is from "The digitaal hoogtemodel vlaanderen" (https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/dhm-digitaal-hoogtemodel-vlaanderen-ii). The lidardata of Flanders is segmented in 43 zones, due to the file size otherwise being to big.

The data contains two differen types of lidardata:

* Digital Surface Model (DSM) represents the earth's surface and includes all objects on it

* Digital Terrain Model (DTM) represents the bare ground surface without any objects like plants and buildings

We need the Canopy Height Model to find the

Digital Surface Map (DSM) and Digital Terrain Map (DTM) are already computed and available from geopunt.be. We just incorporated it to code to be able to plot a certain address that you wanted to plot.



* DSM
* DTM
## Deliverables
1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.

1. Pimp up the readme file:
* What, Why, When, How, Who.
* Pending things to do
1.Show us your results in a nice presentation.

Show us a live demo

Steps
Create the repository
Study the request (What & Why ?)
Download the maps
Identify technical challenges (How ?)
Evaluation criterias
It works (no bugs in the console, no error)
You use Git from the start and during the entire process of the development (at least one push per day)
You convince us during the final presentation
